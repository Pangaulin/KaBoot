# In a nutshell

This project use Node.js and the library [kahoot.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kahoot.js-latest) to flood a Kahoot game with bots. This project is made for educational purposes only.



## Installation

You need to have Node.js and Git (Git is optional) installed on your computer. Type in a terminal :

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Pangaulin/KaBoot.git
  cd KaBoot
  npm i kahoot.js-latest
  node main.js
```
If Git isn't installed on your computer, just download the repository in ZIP, extract it, open the folder, and start a terminal in the folder. Then type these commands :
```bash
npm i kahoot.js-latest
node main.js
```

After the project is started, just write the code of the Kahoot, then choose if you want to use the dictionnary text file for the usernames (the number of bots is equal of the number of usernames in the dictionary), or just use randomly generated nicknames (sends 50 bots into the Kahoot)

## How to use the dictionary
Just open the file **dictionary.txt**, and write the nicknames you want in the Kahoot game, when you want to write a new nickname, just do a new line
```
nickname1
nickname2
nickname3
```
